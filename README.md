### Individual Projects

## API Curious

* [GitHub URL](github.com/amcrawford/thought-post)
* [Production URL](thought-post.herokuapp.com)

In this assignment I created a Twitter-clone using Twitter OAuth and public API.

#### Assessed By: Andrew

#### Notes
Good project. Good UI - the home page and user timeline should have been swapped and would have allowed the student to get a 4. Test coverage could have been better, but overall good.

#### Scores

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 3
* TDD: 3
* Code Quality: 4
* User Experience: 3

## Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](github.com/amcrawford/rails_engine)

In this assignment I created an API.

#### Assessed By: Andrew

#### Notes
Good project. Queries fall to ruby sometimes but does use advanced active record too. TDD was good at the controller level but not at model level. Only two model level.

#### Scores

* Completion: 3
* TDD: 4
* Code Quality: 4
* API Design: 3
* Queries: 3.5

#### Feedback from Peers

* "I was beyond thrilled when I found out I got to work on the TRELORA project with Amber.  She kept the pace of the project consistently moving forward while also pausing to explain concepts that felt off to me.  She is the dark horse candidate in 1508 who quietly works by herself, but ends up producing one of the top apps from front to back.  I cannot wait to see where she ends up in Pittsburgh and would be honored to work alongside her in the future!"

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* I have continued to attend Joan Clarke Society meetings
* Participated in Turing new Buddy Program with Module 1 studentss

## Review

### Notes


### Outcome

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.


## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.


## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.


## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.
